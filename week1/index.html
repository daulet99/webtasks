						The Toyota Highlander is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by Toyota. It is built on the same platform as used on the Toyota Camry, but based on size of the Toyota Avalon chassis.

						Announced in April 2000 at the New York Auto Show and arriving in late 2000 in Japan and January 2001 in North America, the Highlander became one of the first car-based mid-size SUV or mid-size crossovers. The Highlander is the crossover counterpart to the more rugged, truck-based midsize 4Runner and became Toyota's best-selling SUV before being surpassed by the smaller RAV4 in 2006. In Japan, the Kluger is exclusive to dealership network called Toyota NETZ as a larger alternative to the RAV4.

						Unable to use the Highlander name in Japan and Australia because of a trademarked Hyundai Terracan trim line, Toyota calls the vehicle the Toyota Kluger (pronounced Klu-ger) there. The name is derived from the German word klug, which means smart or clever ("Kluger" meaning "one who is smart").

						The Nissan Patrol is a series of four-wheel drive vehicles manufactured by Nissan in Japan and sold throughout the world.

						The Patrol has been available as either a short-wheelbase (SWB) three-door or a long-wheelbase (LWB) five-door chassis since 1951. The LWB version has been offered in pickup truck and cab chassis variants. Between 1988 and 1994, Ford Australia marketed the Patrol as the Ford Maverick. In some European countries the Patrol was marketed by Ebro as the Ebro Patrol. In 1980 in Japan it became known as the Nissan Safari.

						The Y61 platform is manufactured as a military vehicle in countries of Asia and the Middle East. Various versions of the Patrol are widely used by United Nations agencies. Y61 models are produced alongside the current Y62. The fourth and fifth generations are the main troop transport vehicles used by the Irish Army.
